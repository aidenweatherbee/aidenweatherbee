🚀 About Me:
I’m Aiden Weatherbee, an aspiring Space Engineer currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree at York University, with an expected graduation in 2025. My passion lies in the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and space applications. I’m particularly interested in the development of navigation and guidance systems for spacecraft.

🎓 Education:
York University: Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Space Engineering (Expected Graduation: 2025)
Newbridge Academy: Received a full scholarship (Combined Athletic and Academic) for grade 12.
🛰️ Research Experience:
LURA Research with Dr. Zhu, York University: Developed vision code for spacecraft position estimation and gained extensive experience in robotics. I was the only undergraduate in the Smart Art program.
RAY Position with Dr. Zhu, York University: Enhanced vision code for more accurate and computationally efficient position estimation. Collaborated with 2 PhD candidates to autonomously capture spacecraft. Presented monthly updates to MDA and CSA regarding my research.
ESSENCE CubeSat Mission: Co-led the mechanical team in designing a 3u CubeSat with the objective of testing a Canadian developed camera and a solar energetic proton detector. Responsibilities included component selection, CAD modeling, spacecraft layout, budgeting, and thermal simulation. I was chosen for CSA training (canceled due to COVID).
🔭 Independent Research:
Acquired an 8-inch telescope and equipment to perform spectral analysis. Currently developing Python code to process and analyze the spectra of stars.
Building a 1-meter aperture radio astronomy telescope for hydrogen line applications and for receiving satellite images.
💻 Tech Stack:
